As a group, from the very beginning we knew we wanted to make a game. We had always aimed for a 2D platformer
which utilized a unique mechanic, taking advantage of it's medium as a 2D plane. While it went through many
changes through the design process, our original vision has remained intact and we couldn't be happier with the 
end result.

The main features we wished to include were:

        * A mechanic allowing the player to rotate the map, changing the orientation of the platforms
        * A Parallax Background which turned the 2D plane into a 3D perspective
        * Custom animated, and dynamic sprites to bring life to the game
        * A map design which encouraged utilizing the rotate mechanic to its fullest
        * A fully animated player character
        * Custom background music
        


**Controls:**
a            -     move left
d            -     move right
space        -     jump
arrow keys   -     rotate map
e            -     grab
